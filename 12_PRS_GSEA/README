step 1: Extract weight matrix from IBD model
	Because IBD model is from Sung, which works as a 'software', we have to extract weight matrix from its data.
	SCRIPT extract_ibd_prs_weight.R

step 2: Use LD to annotate credible regions for SNPs in PRS model
	I provide an example to do this for T1D model. We should first generate SNPS.txt to fulfill the input format and then use LD-annot for annotation.You can change the vcf files as listed in DATA/LDannotation/ to annotate SNPs from other models.
	SCRIPT LD_annotation.sh

step 3: GSEA analysis for the SNPs.
	Genes were ranked by gene level score, which is sum(|weight| * N), where N = number of alleles in NEER for each SNP.
	DATABASEs for GSEA are in DATA/ref/
	SCRIPT PRS_GSEA.R
	You have to rerun the code to get the GSEA results or you can find GSEA.pptx in the OUTPUT/GSEA/ folder.
